# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud"), enabling individuals and organizations to access resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, on-demand. Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure, users can rent resources from cloud providers, paying only for what they use.

### Advantages of Cloud Computing:


**Cost Efficiency**: Reduces capital expenses by eliminating the need to purchase and maintain hardware.

**Scalability**: Easily scales resources up or down to meet changing demands.

**Flexibility and Accessibility**: Allows users to access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Performance and Reliability**: Provides access to high-performance computing and ensures redundancy to minimize downtime.

**Innovation**: Frees up time and resources, enabling businesses to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.


### Types of Cloud computing services:


**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Offers virtualized computing resources like virtual machines and storage.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides platforms for developing, testing, and deploying applications.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, accessible via a web browser.



The actual most important providers are:


Microsoft Azure

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Google Cloud



# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure is a very complete cloud platform designed to cover a wide range of technological needs. 
It is designed for companies of all sizes, from startups to large corporations, and covers sectors such as application development, artificial intelligence, big data, internet of things (IoT), and more.


As a developer, you can use Azure to easily deploy web apps or APIs.

If you work with machine learning, you have tools to train AI models.

If you are a company that wants to migrate its servers, you can do it with Azure Migrate.

And if you're curious about new technologies like blockchain or quantum computing, Azure has specific services for that too.


Many functionalities complement each other. For example, you can use Azure IoT Hub to connect smart devices and Azure Synapse Analytics to analyze the data generated by them.
